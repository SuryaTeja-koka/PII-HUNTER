## Overview

**PII-Hunter ** is a Python-based command-line utility designed to help you discover sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) such as credit card numbers, email addresses, and phone numbers within files and folders on your machine.  
It recursively scans directories, processes common file types (including PDFs, Excel files, CSVs, and text files), and generates a branded report listing all detected PII.
